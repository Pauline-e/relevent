                            Venue selection is absolutely vital to your events success and is the most critical
                            decision for an event planner.The right venue ensures that your event will be executed
                            to any specifications, and that guests will be surprised and delighted by their
                            experience.On the website you will find an option of choosing the location of
                            your event.Location is an important factor because it can influence the attendees of
                            your event (attendees and speakers).As people come in from different parts of the
                            world mostly to Lagos and Abuja,your venue is in a desirable location and not too far
                            from transport systems (like airports),which means it's easier for people to attend
                            the event.Every building is limited by the number of people who can occupy it at any
                            time. Some rooms are limited as well. Before you start sending invitations, it’s
                            important to make sure the venue can legally and comfortably accommodate your guest
                            list.This decision will likely makeup the largest portion of your budget and will be
                            the vessel used to deliver exciting and quality content to your attendees.

                            At the heart of a successful event planner’s business is a team of reliable vendors.
                            It can’t be overstated:Choosing the right vendors to work with is one of the biggest
                            decisions event creators make.All it takes is one subpar vendor to upset your event
                            logistics and create a bad experience for attendees.The planning of food and drinks
                            at an event is an important process;most unsuccessful food vending experience is
                            mostly due to the bad location of booth and poor communication.The events success
                            can rise or fall on the catering.If the food and drink is not up to scratch, your
                            guests will remember! Things you might not immediately think of can make a real
                            difference too: lighting and event tech, for example, will add a
                            noticeable level of quality to proceedings.Food vendors can make or break an event and
                            that is why making use of a good food vendor is necessary. This food vendors takes
                            the responsibilities of food and drink as well as overseeing the staffing of servers,
                            chefs and others.

                            Event security is the type of service that you can opt for while organizing an event
                            to take care of the safety and security aspects of the event venue. The event security
                            Rel-<i>Event</i> services enhance the experience of the guests present at the event.
                            The professionals of the security service are trained to act in emergency situations
                            and bring the situation under control in proper order.We cannot stress enough the
                            importance of security at events.The planning of your
                            event should begin with a risk assessment taking into account,main examination of
                            your venue and the potential harms that can occur if you do not address them.Your
                            risk assessment will serve as your blueprint for the number of security officers
                            you may need. It will also lay the groundwork for other resources that security
                            may require to have a successful and protected event.In most cases,it’s fine to
                            hire security at events to simply guard entrances and keep an eye on your guests,
                            But event security actually entails far more than just dotting the venue with
                            security personnel. The process is quite complex and requires extensive
                            coordination and communication.Planning a successful event can have its ups and downs.
                            For sure there are some things that are simply out of the control of event organisers
                            and planners, such as the security measurements at the event location and the safety
                            situation in the city.
